QML-Browser, as the name suggests, is a browser for QML files like any other HTML(Web) Browser. Why? Currently, the web is built in HTML, CSS & JavaScript. And that's great, but there are other language that deserve more attention: QML What is QML? QML it is a declarative markup language (like HTML) but instead of being based on XML, it's closer to JSON and supports Javascript for scripting. It can perform everything HTML/CSS can and even more. QML vs HTML Recently, I came across a few articles [1, 2, 3] comparing Qt's modern UI framework\u200a-\u200aQt Quick and its own declarative language QML to HTML, with QML coming out as a clear winner in several categories: Speed of learning Ease of use Performance Cross-platform compatibility Features Basic navigation: back, previous, reload JavaScript API like standard Web APIs Installing From source $ qmake $ make Binary Windows MacOS Linux Running You need to serve QML files using any normal webserver. For example: cd examples/google python3 -m http.server Run the qml-browser and type in the address bar: http://localhost:8000/main.qml JavaScript API Navigation window.back() [method] The back method moves back one page in the history window.forward() [method] Moves forward one page in the session history window.location [property] This property sets or returns the entire URL of the current page Window window.title [property] Dialog This property sets or returns the title of the current page window.alert(message) [method] Displays an alert dialog with th specified message and an OK button. window.prompt(message, value) [method] Returns the text entered by the user in a prompt dialog. window.confirm(message) [method] Displays a dialog with a message that the user needs to respond to. QML module The QmlBrowser module provides QML types similar to basic Web Elements like links (HTML a tag). The QML types can be imported into your application using the following import statement in your .qml file. import QmlBrowser 1.0 LinkArea Identical to MouseArea , but with href property and a default handler for mouse clicks. Example: LinkArea { anchors.fill: parent href: \"http://localhost:8000/page2.qml\" } TextLink Identical to Text , but with href property and a LinkArea inside.
